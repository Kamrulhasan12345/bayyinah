public class NoteRepository {
  // This repository will manage the notes of the user. It will interact with the
  // local database to save and retrieve notes, and also sync with the server
  // when needed.

  // For simplicity, let's assume a note is represented by an ID, a title, and
  // content.

  // We will need methods to:
  // - Create a note
  // - Get a note by ID
  // - Update a note
  // - Delete a note
  // - Sync notes with the server

  // The implementation details will depend on the specific requirements and data
  // models of the application.
